# GrpcApi

This project was to see what it would take to create a C# gRPC server using Web Api and how you would create services that could be called.

**TODO:**

1. **Add more services.**\
     This now contains more than one Grpc endpoint, these consume the proto files that are created outside of the API
3. **Error handling.** 
4. **logging.** 
5. **find a way to add the proto files into a project rather than have them sit outside the various projects.** 
6. **create a python client to connect to the API.**\
      Update: This has changed with new versions of Visual Studio, I will update this project as soon as possible
      Add reference to Python client here
